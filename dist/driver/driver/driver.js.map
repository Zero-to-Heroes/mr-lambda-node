Used for connection pooling. Defaults to the global\n   *     agent (`http.globalAgent`) for non-SSL connections. Note that for\n   *     SSL connections, a special Agent object is used in order to enable\n   *     peer certificate verification. This feature is only available in the\n   *     Node.js environment.\n   *   * **connectTimeout** [Integer] &mdash; Sets the socket to timeout after\n   *     failing to establish a connection with the server after\n   *     `connectTimeout` milliseconds. This timeout has no effect once a socket\n   *     connection has been established.\n   *   * **timeout** [Integer] &mdash; Sets the socket to timeout after timeout\n   *     milliseconds of inactivity on the socket. Defaults to two minutes\n   *     (120000).\n   *   * **xhrAsync** [Boolean] &mdash; Whether the SDK will send asynchronous\n   *     HTTP requests. Used in the browser environment only. Set to false to\n   *     send requests synchronously. Defaults to true (async on).\n   *   * **xhrWithCredentials** [Boolean] &mdash; Sets the \"withCredentials\"\n   *     property of an XMLHttpRequest object. Used in the browser environment\n   *     only. Defaults to false.\n   * @option options apiVersion [String, Date] a String in YYYY-MM-DD format\n   *   (or a date) that represents the latest possible API version that can be\n   *   used in all services (unless overridden by `apiVersions`). Specify\n   *   'latest' to use the latest possible version.\n   * @option options apiVersions [map<String, String|Date>] a map of service\n   *   identifiers (the lowercase service class name) with the API version to\n   *   use when instantiating a service. Specify 'latest' for each individual\n   *   that can use the latest available version.\n   * @option options logger [#write,#log] an object that responds to .write()\n   *   (like a stream) or .log() (like the console object) in order to log\n   *   information about requests\n   * @option options systemClockOffset [Number] an offset value in milliseconds\n   *   to apply to all signing times. Use this to compensate for clock skew\n   *   when your system may be out of sync with the service time. Note that\n   *   this configuration option can only be applied to the global `AWS.config`\n   *   object and cannot be overridden in service-specific configuration.\n   *   Defaults to 0 milliseconds.\n   * @option options signatureVersion [String] the signature version to sign\n   *   requests with (overriding the API configuration). Possible values are:\n   *   'v2', 'v3', 'v4'.\n   * @option options signatureCache [Boolean] whether the signature to sign\n   *   requests with (overriding the API configuration) is cached. Only applies\n   *   to the signature version 'v4'. Defaults to `true`.\n   * @option options dynamoDbCrc32 [Boolean] whether to validate the CRC32\n   *   checksum of HTTP response bodies returned by DynamoDB. Default: `true`.\n   * @option options useAccelerateEndpoint [Boolean] Whether to use the\n   *   S3 Transfer Acceleration endpoint with the S3 service. Default: `false`.\n   * @option options clientSideMonitoring [Boolean] whether to collect and\n   *   publish this client's performance metrics of all its API requests.\n   * @option options endpointDiscoveryEnabled [Boolean] whether to enable endpoint\n   *   discovery for operations that allow optionally using an endpoint returned by\n   *   the service.\n   *   Defaults to 'false'\n   * @option options endpointCacheSize [Number] the size of the global cache storing\n   *   endpoints from endpoint discovery operations. Once endpoint cache is created,\n   *   updating this setting cannot change existing cache size.\n   *   Defaults to 1000\n   * @option options hostPrefixEnabled [Boolean] whether to marshal request\n   *   parameters to the prefix of hostname.\n   *   Defaults to `true`.\n   * @option options stsRegionalEndpoints ['legacy'|'regional'] whether to send sts request\n   *   to global endpoints or regional endpoints.\n   *   Defaults to 'legacy'.\n   */\n  constructor: function Config(options) {\n    if (options === undefined) options = {};\n    options = this.extractCredentials(options);\n\n    AWS.util.each.call(this, this.keys, function (key, value) {\n      this.set(key, options[key], value);\n    });\n  },\n\n  /**\n   * @!group Managing Credentials\n   */\n\n  /**\n   * Loads credentials from the configuration object.

Creating the service\n * instance during instantiation effectively captures the master credentials\n * from the global config, so that subsequent changes to the global config do\n * not affect the master credentials used to refresh the temporary credentials.\n *\n * This allows an instance of AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials to be assigned\n * to AWS.config.credentials:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * var envCreds = new AWS.EnvironmentCredentials('AWS');\n * AWS.config.credentials = envCreds;\n * // masterCredentials will be envCreds\n * AWS.config.credentials = new AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials({\n *   params: {RoleArn: '...'}\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Similarly, to use the CredentialProviderChain's default providers as the\n * master credentials, simply create a new instance of\n * AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * AWS.config.credentials = new ChainableTemporaryCredentials({\n *   params: {RoleArn: '...'}\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * @!attribute service\n *   @return [AWS.STS] the STS service instance used to\n *     get and refresh temporary credentials from AWS STS.\n * @note (see constructor)\n */\nAWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials = AWS.util.inherit(AWS.Credentials, {\n  /**\n   * Creates a new temporary credentials object.\n   *\n   * @param options [map] a set of options\n   * @option options params [map] ({}) a map of options that are passed to the\n   *   {AWS.STS.assumeRole} or {AWS.STS.getSessionToken} operations.\n   *   If a `RoleArn` parameter is passed in, credentials will be based on the\n   *   IAM role.

Each service method that kicks off a request\n * returns an `AWS.Request` object that you can use to register\n * callbacks.\n *\n * For example, the following service method returns the request\n * object as \"request\", which can be used to register callbacks:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * // request is an AWS.Request object\n * var request = ec2.describeInstances();\n *\n * // register callbacks on request to retrieve response data\n * request.on('success', function(response) {\n *   console.log(response.data);\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * When a request is ready to be sent, the {send} method should\n * be called:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * request.send();\n * ```\n *\n * Since registered callbacks may or may not be idempotent, requests should only\n * be sent once. To perform the same operation multiple times, you will need to\n * create multiple request objects, each with its own registered callbacks.\n *\n * ## Removing Default Listeners for Events\n *\n * Request objects are built with default listeners for the various events,\n * depending on the service type. In some cases, you may want to remove\n * some built-in listeners to customize behaviour. Doing this requires\n * access to the built-in listener functions, which are exposed through\n * the {AWS.EventListeners.Core} namespace. For instance, you may\n * want to customize the HTTP handler used when sending a request. In this\n * case, you can remove the built-in listener associated with the 'send'\n * event, the {AWS.EventListeners.Core.SEND} listener and add your own.\n *\n * ## Multiple Callbacks and Chaining\n *\n * You can register multiple callbacks on any request object. The\n * callbacks can be registered for different events, or all for the\n * same event.

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction afterTransform(er, data) {\n  var ts = this._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb) {\n    return this.emit('error', new Error('write callback called multiple times'));\n  }\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (data != null) // single equals check for both `null` and `undefined`\n    this.push(data);\n\n  cb(er);\n\n  var rs = this._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    this._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = {\n    afterTransform: afterTransform.bind(this),\n    needTransform: false,\n    transforming: false,\n    writecb: null,\n    writechunk: null,\n    writeencoding: null\n  };\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  }\n\n  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  this.on('prefinish', prefinish);\n}\n\nfunction prefinish() {\n  var _this = this;\n\n  if (typeof this._flush === 'function') {\n    this._flush(function (er, data) {\n      done(_this, er, data);\n    });\n  } else {\n    done(this, null, null);\n  }\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.
